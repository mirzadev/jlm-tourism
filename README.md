## User Story

```text
As a User of e-commerce I want to regularly visit an e-commerce web site where I can view product, it's price, and then decide to purchase my desired product.

AS a full Stack developer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use MERN and Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
